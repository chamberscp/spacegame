Welcome to the readme for Space Game.

Before you begin your journey into deep space.....

This game uses a bash sehell script to launch the game (spacegame.sh).  
Prior to beggining more development...launching the program easier is as easy as entering the following on the command line.  Substitute my path 
"/home/chamberscp/Git/spacegame/spacegame.sh" for your own path.  Then you will be able to launch the game by typing "sg" on the command line.


alias sg=/home/chamberscp/Git/spacegame/spacegame.sh
